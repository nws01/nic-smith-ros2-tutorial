# nic-smith-ros2-tutorial
Introductory tutorial to ROS2
Background
This is a little tutorial to help you with git, vscode, ROS and docker. Please follow the associated steps. Here you will learn how to create a basic Git repo, and build a basic ROS2 publisher and subscriber in a docker environment.

Acceptance Criteria:
 Create a git repo for your project called nic-smith-ros2-tutorial.
 Download the repository using ssh to your computer
 Setup the project to use a dev container - see the following tutorial https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/tutorial - Use Python as the language when prompted.
Now we have a dev container that contains python - however ROS2 is not installed. We shuold pull from an image that contains ROS2 pre-installed.
 See if you can figure out how to update the docker container to use a ros base image - https://www.allisonthackston.com/articles/vscode-docker-ros2.html
 Using the image from the previous steps we now want to create a basic publisher and subscriber - see https://docs.ros.org/en/foxy/Tutorials/Beginner-Client-Libraries/Writing-A-Simple-Py-Publisher-And-Subscriber.html
Dont forget to commit your changes as you go
